# Escalation Playbook: Ticket Ownership Conflict

## Summary
This playbook is used when two or more technicians are working on the same ticket or a ticket has been incorrectly assigned or escalated.

---

## Symptoms

- Two techs are actively working the same issue
- Ticket was escalated without proper context
- Ticket assigned to the wrong team or technician
- User receives multiple/conflicting responses

---

## Initial Steps (L1)

1. **Pause Work on the Ticket**
   - Don’t duplicate work — add a comment noting you’re pausing for reassignment check

2. **Check Assignment & Routing History**
   - Was it reassigned recently? Who was working it previously?

3. **Communicate Internally**
   - Message the other tech or lead to confirm ownership

4. **Consolidate Progress**
   - Combine findings in one note so whoever takes ownership has full context

---

## Escalation Criteria

Escalate if:
- Ownership is disputed and impacts user response
- Escalation path was skipped (L1 → L3 directly, etc.)
- Ticket has bounced between teams without resolution

---

## Escalation Path

- Escalate to: **Team Lead or Queue Manager**
- Include:
  - Ticket number
  - Current and previous assignments
  - Summary of duplicated or misrouted actions
  - Recommendation for where it should live

---

## Communication

- Priority: **P3 – Medium**
- Notify: Lead of affected team and original technician

---

## Notes

- Always log comments when reassigning or escalating
- Ticket queues should be reviewed daily to prevent stale assignments
