# Escalation Playbook: Device Unresponsive or Frozen

## Summary
User’s computer becomes unresponsive, frozen, or slow to the point of unusable. This may relate to memory, disk, or OS corruption.

---

## Symptoms

- Mouse or keyboard stops working
- Screen freezes with spinning cursor
- Apps won’t open or close
- Entire device slows to a crawl

---

## Initial Troubleshooting (L1)

1. **Ask if Mouse/Keyboard Still Work**
   - If yes, try Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager

2. **Check Task Manager for CPU/Disk Usage**
   - Any apps using 99%+ CPU or Disk?
   - Try ending heavy apps to restore control

3. **Force Restart**
   - Hold Power for 10–15 seconds to force shutdown
   - Reboot and ask if it freezes again

4. **Check Storage Space**
   - Device with <5 GB free can cause freezes
   - Ask user if they’ve seen “Low disk space” warnings

---

## Escalation Criteria

Escalate if:
- Freezes happen repeatedly within the day
- Device hangs even after reboot
- Task Manager cannot be opened
- Disk is almost full and cannot be cleared

---

## Escalation Path

- Escalate to: **Desktop Support or Imaging Team**
- Include:
  - Device name and user
  - Description of behavior
  - Steps already attempted
  - Screenshot (if possible)
  - Last successful reboot or uptime

---

## Communication

- Priority: **P2 – High**
- Notify: Onsite support if physical access is required

---

## Notes

- Devices with near-full drives may need profile wipe or reimage
- SSDs failing may show symptoms like freezing under light use
