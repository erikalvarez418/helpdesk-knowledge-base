## Escalation Format

**Ticket Title:**  
User unable to access SharePoint site

**User:**  
Jane Doe (jdoe@company.com)

**Device:**  
JDOE-LAPTOP01 – Windows 10 – Company-owned

**Issue Summary:**  
User receives "Access Denied" when opening shared SharePoint folder  
Confirmed correct URL and browser settings – user is in expected Teams group but still denied access

**Steps Taken So Far:**
- Cleared cache and cookies
- Tried in Edge and Chrome
- Verified user is in “Operations Team” group
- Checked Microsoft 365 group permissions

**Next Suggestion / Blocker:**  
May need admin to verify folder-level permissions or group sync

**Priority / Impact:**  
Medium – User blocked from accessing team documents

## Notes

- Post in ticket AND notify the receiving team (via Teams, Slack, or direct assignment)
- Keep escalation clear and objective
