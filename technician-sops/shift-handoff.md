# Shift Handoff SOP

## Summary
A smooth handoff between shifts ensures that work continues without delays or dropped tickets. This SOP outlines what to document and how to communicate during handover.

## When to Use This

- Transitioning between AM/PM shifts
- Before taking time off or going offline
- Rotating through weekly support coverage

## Handoff Checklist

1. **Update All Open Tickets**
   - Add a comment summarizing current status
   - Mention: pending user response, vendor follow-up, or next steps

2. **Highlight High-Priority Items**
   - P1 or VIP tickets still open
   - Anything due today or currently unresolved

3. **Communicate Blockers**
   - What can’t move forward and why
   - Who you're waiting on (user, team, vendor)

4. **Mention Any Known Outages or Trends**
   - Ongoing issue with email, printing, etc.
   - Spikes in phishing or alerts

5. **Notify Next Tech or Team**
   - Slack, Teams, or ticket system update
   - Mention key tickets by number or title

## Notes

- Use consistent tagging or labels to flag handoff items (e.g., “Follow-Up AM”)
- If no one is covering the next shift, leave full notes in the ticket
