# Outlook Not Receiving Emails

## Summary
User reports that they are not receiving new emails in Outlook, even though others can send and receive normally. This can be caused by sync issues, filters, rules, or profile corruption.

## Common Symptoms
- Inbox not updating with new messages
- Only receiving emails in Outlook Web (OWA), not desktop app
- Messages delayed or appear all at once later
- No error, but emails just donâ€™t show

## Quick Fixes

1. **Check Internet & Outlook Status**
   - Bottom bar in Outlook should say **"Connected to Microsoft Exchange"**
   - If it says **"Working Offline"** or **"Disconnected"**, reconnect or check network

2. **Check Outlook Web App (OWA)**
   - Go to [https://outlook.office.com](https://outlook.office.com)
   - If emails appear there but not in the desktop app, the issue is local

3. **Check Filters and View Settings**
