## Advanced Troubleshooting

1. **Test in Outlook Web App (OWA)**

2. **Clear Stuck Items**
   - Go to **Outbox** > Move stuck messages to **Drafts**
   - Try re-sending or editing them

3. **Repair Outlook Profile**
   - Go to **Control Panel > Mail > Show Profiles**
   - Click **Email Accounts > Repair** on the affected profile

4. **Create New Outlook Profile**
   - In **Mail Setup**, choose **Add...** to create a new profile
   - Set the new profile as default and test again

5. **Check for Large Attachments**
   - Emails over 20â€“25MB may not send
   - Use OneDrive or compress large files

## Notes
- If emails send fine in OWA but not in the desktop app, focus on profile or local network issues
