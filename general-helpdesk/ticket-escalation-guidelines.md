# Ticket Escalation Guidelines

## Summary
Not every issue can or should be solved by the first person who sees it. These guidelines help you determine when and how to escalate a ticket to the right team or tier.

---

## When to Escalate

- Issue exceeds your access level or technical scope
- Requires a system or tool you don't manage
- Involves sensitive data, legal risk, or compliance
- Repeated fixes are not working
- No progress after 2–3 troubleshooting steps
- User requests escalation or issue affects leadership

## How to Escalate Properly

1. **Document Everything**
   - Include all steps taken, user feedback, and test results

2. **Summarize Clearly**
   - Example: “User cannot sync OneDrive — tried sign out/in, reset app, verified credentials — issue persists on multiple networks”

3. **Tag or Assign Correctly**
   - Assign to the correct tier/team (e.g., Network, SysAdmin, M365)

4. **Include Artifacts**
   - Screenshots, logs, ticket history, time of failure, and device names

5. **Set Appropriate Priority**
   - High for executive/urgent
