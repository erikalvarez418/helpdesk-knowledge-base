## Quick Steps for Most Issues

1. **Reboot**
   - Confirm user/device has been rebooted recently

2. **Replicate the Issue**
   - Try it yourself or ask user to show what’s happening

3. **Check Network/Connectivity**
   - Wi-Fi, VPN, and internet access OK?

4. **Check for User Errors**
   - Wrong account, password typo, saved credentials

5. **Verify Permissions**
   - Access denied? Confirm AD groups or M365 roles

6. **Run Troubleshooters**
   - Built-in tools in Windows or Microsoft 365

7. **Check System Status**
   - Go to https://status.office365.com or verify local outages

8. **Test on Another Device**
   - Helps isolate between user profile vs system-wide issues

9. **Collect Logs or Screenshots**
   - Use Snip & Sketch or Event Viewer
